#### INTRODUCTION
First bigger project, inspired by homework assignment. I learnt a lot about React/SCSS, first time doing "few sites" with React thanks to react-router, a lot of SCSS grind through.

#### DESCRIPTION
Start page component with cool design. Sign in button to Login/register components with validation (log in with anything then "test/test"). Main component which takes data from public/vehicles.json, then render it with the possibility of filtering. Little components to theoretically show profile and after clicking "MAKE AN APPOINTMENT".

#### USED TECHNOLOGIES
React, SCSS

#### HOW TO
Open folder with project files, run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies, then run `npm start`. Site should be available at `localhost:3000`
